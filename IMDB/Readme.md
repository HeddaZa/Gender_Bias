We study here gender biases in the IMDB. We start from the list of titles provided by the IMDB (https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) and use the gender-guesser (https://pypi.org/project/gender-guesser/) library to infer the gender of a given director.

While the votes distribution is very similar for Male and Female directors, the movies by Female directors tend to have less votes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO:
- ratings + number of votes: possibility: filter by genre and then gender
- are synopsis genderised?
- ratings split into stars via beautiful soap
- ratings split by stars: how are they distributed in regards of the gender of the director?
